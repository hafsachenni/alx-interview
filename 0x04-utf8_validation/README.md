# UTF-8 Validation Project

This project involves validating whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding using Python programming skills, bitwise operations, and understanding of the UTF-8 encoding scheme.


## Concepts Covered

### Bitwise Operations in Python
- Understanding and manipulating bits using operators like AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>).
- [Python Bitwise Operators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators)

### UTF-8 Encoding Scheme
- Knowledge of how characters are encoded into one or more bytes according to UTF-8 rules.
- Recognizing patterns that signify a valid UTF-8 encoded character.
- [UTF-8 on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
- [Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/)

### Data Representation
- Handling data at the byte level and simulating byte data by manipulating least significant bits (LSB) of integers.

### List Manipulation in Python
- Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and utilizing list comprehensions.
- [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

### Boolean Logic
- Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program based on UTF-8 validation rules.
