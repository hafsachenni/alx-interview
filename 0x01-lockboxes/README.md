# Unlocking Boxes Challenge

## Overview
This project involves solving a problem where we have a series of locked boxes, each potentially containing keys to other boxes. The goal is to determine if all the boxes can be opened given that the first box is initially unlocked.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, we should be able to:
- Understand and implement algorithms for traversing and unlocking a series of locked boxes.
- Apply problem-solving techniques to ensure all boxes can be opened from an initial state.
- Work with lists and sets to manage and track keys and boxes.

## Task Description
We have `n` number of locked boxes in front of us. Each box is numbered sequentially from `0` to `n - 1` and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.
