# Minimum Operations Project

## Overview
This project aims to devise a solution that efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations to achieve a given number of characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. To accomplish this task, several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts are required, including dynamic programming, prime factorization, code optimization, greedy algorithms, and basic Python programming.
