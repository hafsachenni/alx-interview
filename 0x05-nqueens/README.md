# N Queens 

## Overview

The N Queens problem is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics. The goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Key Concepts

#### Backtracking Algorithms

Backtracking is a technique used to solve problems by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, and removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem. For the N Queens problem, backtracking helps in exploring all possible placements of queens on the board until a valid solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

#### Recursion

Recursion is a fundamental technique in programming where a function calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem. In the context of the N Queens problem, recursion is often used in conjunction with backtracking to explore and backtrack through possible board configurations.

#### List Manipulations in Python

Python lists are versatile data structures used extensively in this project to represent and manipulate the chessboard and queen placements. Lists are used to store positions, check constraints, and manage the state of the board during the solution search.

#### Python Command Line Arguments

The project may utilize command-line arguments to specify the size of the chessboard (N) and other optional parameters. Python's `sys.argv` from the `sys` module is typically used to handle command-line arguments passed to the script.
